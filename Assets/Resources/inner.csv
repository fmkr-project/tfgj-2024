1885; Great Hakurei Barrier; Gensokyo is isolated from the Outside World.; TODO; Still haven't bought yet Nihon no Rekishi 16 to 19 to understand what's going on.; Sorry but I didn't either.

1923; Kanto earthquake; The Kanto Great Earthquake is felt in Gensokyo.; TODO; ...that is, if the Japanese Touhou Wiki is a reliable source.; Pics or it didn't happen.

1970; Apollo 13; Lunarians witness the failure of the Apollo 13 mission.; TODO; It's technically not <i>inside</i> the Barrier, but I needed an event to make some cards work.; Keine-sensei, are you sure this falls into the "Inside the Barrier" category?

1994; Akyuu's birth; The ninth child of Miare is born.; TODO; Huzzah! More unpaid workforce to continue writing the Chronicle!; (with visible joy) HI AKYUU!!!

2003; EoSD events; A scarlet fog covers the skies of Gensokyo.; TODO; Alternate title: Reimu visits the Western mansion in Yamate-cho, Yokohama, and bonks some people.; It was quite beautiful to watch actually. Too bad there were quite a few clouds back then.

2004; PCB events; Anormally long winter in Gensokyo.; TODO; Alternate title: Nothing really happened. It turns out that Gensokyo is actually a small plot of land near Koishi, Sarufutsu-mura, Hokkaido. (And Reimu bonks some ghosts.); I don't really like winter. There's no heater in Suzunaan for quite obvious reasons. And I've had my fair share of fire-related events recently.

2007; MoF events; A remote shrine is set up on top of Youkai Mountain.; TODO; Alternate title: Reimu pays a visit to the local shrine and bonks some gods and tengu in the process.; It's Green Reimu! She doesn't come often to the village, but people seem to like her.

2008; SWR events; A localized earthquake destroys the Hakurei Shrine.; TODO; Alternate title: Reimu interrupts her daily routine (?) to go to heaven and bonk a celestial. And an oarfish apparently.; Reordering every single one of the books here was an actual pain.

2015; LoLK events; Unrest in the Lunar Capital.; TODO; Alternate title: Reimu actually travels more than 380,000 km to the Moon in what seems like 30-40 minutes, and also bonks bnuuys and other Lunarians in the process.; Isn't the owner from that dango shop actually a Lunarian too?

2024; Akyuu's death; The ninth child of Miare is expected to die.; Walfas; Honestly, never thought she would climb to 39th place during this year's Popularity Vote.; Wh... what? Well, to be fair, she was coughing a bit when she visited last week, but it's neither here nor there...
